# Minigames
A few small fun games.
This is an automated Bingo game. The player is given a randomized Bingo card to start with. Then, the computer selects a number
and if the number is on your card the computer will replace it with an 'X' for you. If you get 5 in a row (it has been done),
you win. If you don't after all six numbers are selected, you have lost the game.
